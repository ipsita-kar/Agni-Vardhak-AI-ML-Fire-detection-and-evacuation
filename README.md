So we developed Agni-Vardhak a project that integrates Fast All in One Dehazing (FAOD-Net) and Dark Channel Prior Algorithms which increases visibility of firefighters during structural fires hence facilitating rescue and assessment efforts and saving lives.

We employed shortest path algorithms for saving time during critical situations.

📌 How it works ?
![logo]()
Agni-Vardhak revolutionizes fire response with its user-friendly platform for uploading fire-related data from our app or CCTV footage. The FAOD algorithm, it swiftly detects and responds to incidents, allowing victims to send distress signals to nearby firefighters via streamlined coordination with Google API. Additionally, the AI/ML technology analyzes smoke severity, while object detection enhances assessment accuracy. With added features like rewards, fire safety information, and QR-based donations.

📌 Techstack:

· Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV for AI/ML development.

· Google Maps API for location-based services.

· Google Cloud for hosting.

· Figma for UI/UX design

📌 Why?

Traditional fire-detection systems primarily rely on sensor-based detection techniques, which have inherent limitations in accurately and promptly detecting fires, especially in complex environments. In recent years, with the advancement of computer vision technology, video-oriented fire detection techniques, owing to their non-contact sensing, adaptability to diverse environments, and comprehensive information acquisition have emerged as a novel solution. As a powerful and flexible machine learning framework, deep learning has demonstrated significant advantages in video fire detection.

📌 Conclusion

We have a Ctrl+Z in our laptops to undo our mistakes , but during intense fire accidents there is no UNDO , this is just an initiative to reduce the casualties because each and every life matters.

📌 Special Thanks to my diverse mix of Teammates from 1st year Sukhirthan Arun ,Srri Hari T R from 2nd Year Hema Shree ,Aswin Chandrasekar and 3rd year Lohesh M .Their constant dedication, hard work, collaborative meetings, and guidance were instrumental in bringing this project to life.
